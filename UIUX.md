I try make the website as minimalist as possible without making it lack utility, not clutterring the UI with different useless information. Everything is clearly labelled, When you are in the 

I try to have the website follow a consistent color scheme (white and purple), font, and button colours and sizes.

I try to give feedback as much as possible, such as when deleting a question, it will immideately disappear from the screen rather than waiting for the user to refresh the page. Clicking buttons such as saving will take the user to another page if successful to indicate a successful input. 

I try to have placeholders to tell the user what to do, for different inputs to explain certain functions that might be unclear. Cursors will change to pointer while hovered if it is clickable. 

I try to follow common standards such as, clicking logo leads to homepage/dashboard, Navigation Bar at the top, and have symbols that follow real world application (such as garbage can to delete).
